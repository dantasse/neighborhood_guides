This is stuff I'm not using now but storing in case I need it in the future. 

`2016_pgh_blotter` and `pgh_crime` are both attempts to figure out crime stats in Pittsburgh. They have some codes about what kind of crime it is, which are from:

[Atlanta PD](http://www.atlantapd.org/pdf/crime-data-downloads/28.pdf) or [Tucson PD](http://nsn.soaz.info/files/TPDUCRCodes.pdf)

Original sources of the data:

- `pgh_crime.csv` is from the Western Pennsylvania Open Data Portal [Tableau file we extracted CSV from](https://public.tableau.com/profile/alleghenycountydhsdare#!/vizhome/OverallTrendsinViolence_Public_8-12-16/OverallTrend), [overall crime data page](http://www.wprdc.org/crime/)
- [Police blotter archive](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data)
