npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

`index.html` here should probably not be touched by us; webpack (I think) will stuff the whole site we build into there.
You can probably ignore `build/`, `config`, `package.json`, `static`, and `test` too. All our code goes in `src`.
