# Neighborhood Guides, The Site

## Getting started:

- install Node.js via via homebrew (`brew install node`) or maybe apt-get or whatever you've got? That will install NPM along the way.
- in this directory, `npm install` (will read `package.json` and install all the dependencies you'll need). 
- future instructions to be determined! I'm new at javascript.
